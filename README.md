### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

- The labs were a major help in the assignment as it included various parts that involved the same techniques used in the assignment, such as the load more button, the fetch function, the use of API keys, etc. I just wish we had gone over a bit more on CSS as it caused some problems in my assignment, such as not being able to put my movies into grid view as it messed up my code. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
- If I had more time on the project I would have have liked to add more sections featuring different movie selections such as Top Rated, Upcomimg Movies, and Genres rather than only the Now Playing movies. I would also have spend more time making accessbility features such as changing the website's color for those who are blind or adding text to speech for those who are hard of hearing. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

- As seen by my walkthrough, my project is not in grid view due to the way I had fetched the movies images, titles, and ratings. For this reason I had to adapt and added a scroll to the top of the page button for the user. My peers were able to get the movies in grid view and did their best to help me despite me not being able to fix. I will have to keep this in mind next time I code, to consider how the order and container sections will affect the output of the features. I am hoping I can only improve from here on now and avoid these mistakes. 

### Open-source libraries used

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

- I would like to thank my CodePath mentor, Tirumari, he had answered several questions I had about my assignment and also did a great job answering my peers' questions throughout the whole week.
